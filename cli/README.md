# Nautilus CLI

## 🚧 In Development

To run this CLI in development, enter the root directory and run `cargo build`.   
   
Then, enter the root directory of your program and run:
```shell
<path-to-cli>/cli/target/debug/nautilis-cli <command>
```
For example, if you're running it from the `program-nautilus` test program in this repository (under `test-programs`):
```shell
../../../cli/target/debug/nautilis-cli <command>
```
